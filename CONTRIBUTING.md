# Contribution Guidelines

We, the authors of the SmartEDA R package, use the same guide as is used for contributing to the development of R packages such as `data.table` and `biotmle`. This document is simply a formal re-statement of that fact.

All developers are very much welcome to contribute to code, enhance, provide documentation, 
and perfomr testing. We look forward to more suggestions from your end.

SmartEDA is a new R package. If you're new to coding and submitting pull requests (PRs), 
we encourage you to try. You can submit some recommendations in the issues or start coding a 
function or adding some parameters or fixing a bug or just rewriting a bit so that it is clear, 
well documented and understandable. Please do not hesitate to submit your changes. We will work 
together to integrate them.
